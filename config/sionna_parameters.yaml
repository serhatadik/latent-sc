# Sionna RT Propagation Model Parameters

# Frequency in Hz (3534 MHz = 3.534 GHz)
frequency_hz: 3.534e9

# Transmitter height in meters (for grid points)
transmitter_height_m: 8.8

# Receiver height in meters (for sensors)
receiver_height_m: 2.0

# Map file path (relative to project root or absolute)
map_file: "SLCmap_5May2022.mat"

# Scene cache directory (generated scenes stored here)
scene_cache_dir: "./data/sionna_scenes"

# Generated scene XML filename
